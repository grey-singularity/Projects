The aim of this project is to develop smart pampers for neonatal care, specifically designed to aid infants with diabetes.
The pampers will incorporate sensors to measure urine volume, glucose concentration, pH level, and wetness. The data
collected from these sensors will be used to monitor the health of the infant and provide healthcare professionals with
valuable information to manage their care. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the quality of life for infants
with diabetes and reduce the risk of complications associated with the condition.

OBJECTIVE

• To develop a novel solution for monitoring glucose levels in infants with diabetes using smart pampers.
• To develop a system that can detect and quantify the volume of urine produced by infants to aid in diabetes
management.
• To create a platform for continuous monitoring of glucose levels, urine volume, pH, and wetness in infants with
diabetes to assist in the management of their condition.
• To explore the potential of smart pampers as a tool for improving the quality of life of infants with diabetes and
their caregivers.
